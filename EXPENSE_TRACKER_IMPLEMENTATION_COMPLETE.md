## 🚨 Next Steps (USER MUST DO)

### 1. **Run SQL Script in Supabase** (REQUIRED)

You **MUST** run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard before testing:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
4. Copy the SQL from `EXPENSE_TRACKER_SETUP.md` (lines 18-57)
5. Run the query

**Without this step, the expense tracker will not work!**

### 2. **Test the Application**

1. Dev server is running at `http://localhost:5173`
2. Navigate to **Plugins** page
3. Install **💰 Expense Tracker** plugin
4. Go to **💰 Expenses** in navigation
5. Add a test expense
6. Verify it appears in the table
7. Check Dashboard for the widget

## 📊 Technical Details

### Database Schema

```sql
Table: expenses
- id (UUID, primary key, auto-generated)
- store (TEXT, not null)
- date (DATE, not null)
- amount (DECIMAL(10,2), not null, > 0)
- category (TEXT, not null)
- notes (TEXT, nullable)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, auto)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, auto)

Indexes:
- idx_expenses_date (date DESC)
- idx_expenses_category (category)
- idx_expenses_created (created_at DESC)

RLS: Enabled (all operations allowed for MVP)
```

### API Operations

```javascript
expenseStorage.getAll()              // Get all expenses
expenseStorage.add(expense)          // Add new expense
expenseStorage.update(id, expense)   // Update expense
expenseStorage.delete(id)            // Delete expense
expenseStorage.getByMonth(y, m)      // Get by month
expenseStorage.getByCategory(cat)    // Filter by category
```

### Environment Variables

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://oqxumrsqkuzjfxfdawhj.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=sb_publishable_3fUkyt4evDPe_GfyqZBPxw_AmKNGWIy
```
